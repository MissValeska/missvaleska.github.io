# Netsukuku 
One of the most complicated and in-depth projects I have ever worked on, with the loftiest goals: To replace the internet, to provide better internet access to the places that need it most, to help resolve the net neutrality and censorship situation present in many countries around the world. https://github.com/Netsukuku/netsukuku
